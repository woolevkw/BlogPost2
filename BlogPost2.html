    <h1>How I Got My Own Personal Domain Name For Less Than $15</h1>
    <p style="font-size:25px;">Everyone should know how to do this!!! Ep. 2</p>
  </div>

  <p>Having a personal domain name to yourself means you can have your own website that can be used for anything.
    I plan to set up my peronal website as an online portfolio of all the pieces of work I have done while here at
    Clarkson University. I can then use that portfolio to send to potential employers so they can see all the work
    I am capable of doing inclucing creating this mini blog series.

  <h4>Here are the basic steps:</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>First, figure out what you want your domain name to be and/or represent.
      <ul>
          <li>I used my full name which is perfect for representing my portfolio.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Next, figure out where you want to get your domain name from.
      <ul>
          <li>Domain names are not free so you will have to buy from places such as Google Domains or GODADDY.</li>
          <li>I personally went through Google Domains.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>After you have an idea of what you want your domain name to be, you have to run a domain name search to see what the best available option is.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>No two domain names may be exact. I am lucky enough to have my full name as my domain name because my name is not that common.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Pick the best domain name that is available to you.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Try to make the name sound as professional as possible.</li>
          <li>Do not use out dated language and avoid using numbers for words (2, 4, U, etc).</li>
          <li>Also, make sure the domain name is not too long. People don't want to type in a lot of words when they want to find your site.</li>
          <li>Lastly, if your domain name is not readable then people will not want to visit your site..</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Next, you need to figure out what extension you want at the end of your name.</li>
      <li>The most common extensions are ".com" ".org" ".net" and ".co"</li>
      <ul>
          <li>This is a difficult part because there are adtantages and disadvateages of all of them.</li>
          <li>I personally use ".com" because it is the most popular and it was available to me for a cheap price.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Now that you have picked out your domain name and extension, move on to purchase it.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Custom domain names are not free remember, so you will need your wallet near by.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>There are going to be some forms that you will need to fill out such as your full name and place of residence.</li>
      <li>After you fill out the forms and enter your credit card information, you are good to go!</li>
      <ul>
          <li>If you have any questions or troubles, the site you are trying to get your domain from will have some sort of support you can use for more assistance.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>And there you go! Now you have your own personal Domain Name!</p>
